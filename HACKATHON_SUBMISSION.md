### Multi-Agent System Design with MCP
Our system is built on a robust multi-agent architecture, where each agent specializes in a specific function and communicates seamlessly via the Model Context Protocol (MCP). This design ensures scalability, modularity, and efficient task execution.

1.  **MCP Server (src/mcp/mcp_server_proper.py)**: The central hub for all agent communication, facilitating discovery and interaction between different agents.
2.  **Voice Service Agent (src/voice/voice_service.py)**: Handles all speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversions, integrating with various voice providers (local pyttsx3 and ElevenLabs).
3.  **Appointment Agent (src/agents/langchain_mcp_agent.py)**: The core agent responsible for scheduling logic, managing doctor availability, and resolving scheduling conflicts. It leverages LangChain for complex reasoning and tool use.
4.  **Gmail Agent (src/agents/gmail_agent.py)**: Manages all email communications, sending appointment confirmations, reminders, and alerts to patients and doctors.
5.  **WhatsApp Agent (src/agents/whatsapp_agent.py)**: Handles WhatsApp messaging for notifications, reminders, and interactive communication, including the ability to send voice messages.
6.  **Dynamic Alerts Agent (src/agents/dynamic_alerts_agent.py)**: Manages real-time alerts for critical events like doctor delays, appointment postponements, or emergencies. It triggers multi-channel notifications through the Gmail and WhatsApp agents.
